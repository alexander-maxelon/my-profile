				<h2>About</h2>
				<h3>Inspired by difference</h3>
				<h4 class="text-italic">„Change the way you look at things and the things you see will change.”</h4>
				<p>
					This quote is from the American psychologist and author Wayne Dyer and describes one of my most important principles: Trying to understand other people and cultures by adapting one’s own perspective to theirs. In the past, I have achieved this by spending a year in the USA and most recently in China. The hereby recognized cultural differences and similarities are not only relevant for my studies in International Business Administration at <strong>WHU – Otto Beisheim School of Management</strong>, but they most importantly enrich me personally. Combined with my two greatest passions, photography and journalism, international encounters enable me to tell stories, either in the form of a picture or as a written article.

				<h2>Photography</h2>
				<h3>Capturing the moment</h3>
				<p>
					<i>„Photography is not looking, it’s feeling. If you can’t feel what you’re looking at, then you’re never going to get others to feel anything when they look at your pictures.”</i> (Don McCullin)

				<h2>Journalism</h2>
				<h3>Learning & Informing</h3>
				<p>
					Whether economy, politics, culture or technology. I love researching topics, discussing them with people and continuously educating myself. For me, journalism is both a tool and a language, and every article a unique opportunity to understand the world a little better.

				<h3>What differentiates me</h3>
				<p>
					Diversity is nowadays a popular buzzword. But the more one specializes, the smaller the differences of individual characters seem to become. That’s why I don’t just put my business expertise in the foreground of this website, but also want to point out my interests and strengths outside of this field.

				<h3>What others say</h3>
				<p>
					The famous German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe said once, the human character rests in the personality and not on one’s talents. In the following are therefore some references from people with whom I have worked intensively in the past and who therefore know me particularly well.
